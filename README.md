**Have you ever forget how many drinks you had last night?**
**Have you ever wondered if your drinking habits are sane?**

iDrank comes in handy allowing you to track your alcohol (or any other beverage) consumption with a simple and clear mobile application.
Create a party and add drinks in one of the 2 modes (shot / long drink) to watch how the consumption graph is growing.
Revisit historical parties and share your results with friends. Keep track of current consumption and know your limits!
